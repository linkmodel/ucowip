## PREFIXES
## ------------
# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of
# the UCOLink Model specification are resolved using a specific precedence order,
# for use in the generation of the UCOLink Model context.jsonld mappings to
# namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the UCOLink Model but not resolved by
# the following precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as
# http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's which should ideally be repaired
# in one of the precedence lists.
#
# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.
