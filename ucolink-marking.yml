# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of
# the UCOLink Model specification are resolved using a specific precedence order,
# for use in the generation of the UCOLink Model context.jsonld mappings to
# namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the UCOLink Model but not resolved by
# the following precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as
# http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's which should ideally be repaired
# in one of the precedence lists.

# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.

  granular marking:

      A granular marking is a grouping of characteristics unique to specification of marking definitions (restrictions, permissions, and other guidance for how data can be used and shared) that apply to particular portions of a particular UCO object.

  release to marking:
    description: >-
      A release-to marking is a grouping of characteristics unique to the expression of data marking definitions (restrictions, permissions, and other guidance for how data can be used and shared) to convey details of authorized persons and/or organizations to which to the associated content may be released. The existence of the Release-To marking restricts access to ONLY those identities explicitly listed, regardless of whether another data marking exists that allows sharing with other members of the community.

  statement marking:
    description: >-
      A statement marking is a grouping of characteristics unique to the expression of data marking definitions (restrictions, permissions, and other guidance for how data can be used and shared) to convey details of a textual marking statement, (e.g., copyright) whose semantic meaning should apply to the associated content. Statement markings are generally not machine-readable. An example of this would be a simple marking to apply copyright information, such as 'Copyright 2014 Acme Inc.'.

  terms of use marking:
    description: >-
      A terms of use marking is a grouping of characteristics unique to the expression of data marking definitions (restrictions, permissions, and other guidance for how data can be used and shared) to convey details of a textual statement specifying the Terms of Use (that is, the conditions under which the content may be shared, applied, or otherwise used) of the marked content. An example of this would be used to communicate a simple statement, such as 'Acme Inc. is not responsible for the content of this file'.
